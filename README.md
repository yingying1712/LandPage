# Project: Landing Page

For this project, I will be creating an entire web page. It is a practice for me to build a full page using the Flexbox method in HTML and CSS.  

This project will be a fan page for the group SEVENTEEN. It is just for fun ^^  I don’t even have an idea of what content to create for this landing page. So I chose to make a fan page because SEVENTEEN is my favourite artist group right now ><
